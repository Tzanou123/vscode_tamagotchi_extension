# tamagotchi VS-Code extension README

Welcome to the Tamagotchi VS-Code Extension, a fun and interactive game that brings the joy of raising Tamagotchi pets right into your favorite code editor.

## Features

With this extension, every single character you write helps you grow your very own Tamagotchi pet family. The more you code, the more your pets grow and evolve. It's a delightful way to make your coding sessions more enjoyable and rewarding.
